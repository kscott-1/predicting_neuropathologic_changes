This folder contains all the files you need to preprocess from raw data received from NACC (example shown in df_samples.csv) to become data suitable for the input/output for the model.

To use it,

1. Make sure you have the dataframe in a format looking like df_samples.csv. This should be the standard data received from NACC.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook
3. The output (X_UDS_caseII) in the last cell will have the values preprocessed suitable for the model, you may need to subset to certain columns to run in the model

Note the panda v
